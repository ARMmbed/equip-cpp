#Voytalk Library for mbed OS

Devices, whether connected or not, usually require configuration to make them work. This configuration process can present a real challenge for users that are less confident with technology, and is a recurring annoyance for those that are. Today, each product implements a different system, with a different user interface, using different conventions, different button combinations, with different flashing lights and different bleeps. This is bad for users, constraining for designers and complex for developers.

The mbed Provisioning App provides a simple, flexible system for a device to ask for input from the user. This is library for use with mbed OS to support the mbed Provisioning App.
